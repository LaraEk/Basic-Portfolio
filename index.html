    <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I'm interested in everything, with very few exceptions. I write and read science fiction, fantasy, and anything speculative. I speak enough languages for half my fingers, have enough books to found a small library, and love to talk about ideas. I love the natural world, and go out in it as often as possible.
