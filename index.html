    <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I'm interested in everything, with very few exceptions. I write and read science fiction, fantasy, and anything speculative. I speak enough languages for half my fingers, have enough books to found a small library, and love to talk about ideas. I love the natural world, and go out in it as often as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've got a few short stories and a poem published.  Feel free to head on over to my <a href="writing.html">Writing Page</a> to learn more, or to visit my Author Pages on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lara-Ek/e/B01N4F2TQD">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5441095.Lara_Ek">Goodreads</a>.
